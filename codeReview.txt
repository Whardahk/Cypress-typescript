Autonation Testing : Saucelabs
Language used : typescript
Framework used: cypress
How to run: 
  1. npx cypress open -> will open new window browser and running the automation test
  2. npx cypress run  -> will running the automation test in terminal

After run with 'npx cypress open' -> need to change the directory due to migration to e2e testing based on cypress recommendation

Code Review:
Focus on the cypress/e2e/*.cy.ts
i.e: login.cy.ts
  create class and got the variable from the pages folder.
  i.e:let loginPage = new LoginPage(); - loginPage is from "./pages/login_pages.cy";
on the it function "Test LOGIN", it called the class loginPage 
  and the method called are login and assertLogin
on the method 'login' it have 3 parameters (URL, username, password) it used for everytime user login
on the method 'assertLogin' it doen't have parameters but it will assert the data after login successfuly and the data are:
  - assert get class title and should be visible
  - assert get class peek and should be visible
  - assert text should have 'Products' on the page
